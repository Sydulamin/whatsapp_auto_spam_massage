# Pest: Auto Spam Message Poster

Pest is a Python-based automation script designed to automate the process of posting spam messages at specified locations on a webpage or application. It uses Python libraries for automation and interaction with the graphical interface. Below are the detailed steps to set up, configure, and run the script.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A text editor or IDE to edit the code (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of how to use the command line.

If Python is not installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step-by-Step Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Install Python

First, ensure that Python is installed on your machine. To check if Python is already installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
python --version


Step 2: Create a Python Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment is recommended to keep your dependencies isolated. To create a virtual environment, open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
This command will create a new folder called venv in your project directory, which contains an isolated Python environment.

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it.

Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
You should see (venv) at the beginning of the command line, indicating that the virtual environment is now active.

Step 4: Install Required Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, the next step is to install the necessary Python libraries. These libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

Running the Script
Once the setup is complete and the dependencies are installed, you can run the script.

Step 1: Run the Script
To run the script, execute the following command in the terminal (make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated):

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the actual name of the script you want to run (e.g., pest.py).

Step 2: Interact with the Script
The script will start running and prompt you to click on the areas where you want to post spam messages.
Follow the on-screen instructions. You may need to click buttons, text fields, or other interactive elements on a webpage or application.
The script will automatically send predefined spam messages to the selected locations.
Once the message posting locations are set, the automation will handle the process until it's completed.

How It Works
Starting the Script: After executing the script, it waits for user input to define where the spam messages should be posted.
Click Interaction: The script will prompt you to click on the locations where you want to send the spam message.
Posting Spam Messages: Once the locations are selected, the script will automatically post predefined messages at those spots.
Automation: The entire process is automated, so after setting it up, you can leave it to run with minimal interaction.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the script, here are some common solutions:

ModuleNotFoundError: If you get an error about missing modules, it means some dependencies were not installed. To fix this, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Permission Denied: If you get a permission error, try running the command as an administrator (on Windows) or with sudo (on macOS/Linux):

bash
Copy code
sudo python script_name.py
Script Not Running: If the script doesn't start, make sure you're using the correct version of Python by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
If it shows a different version, try running the script with python3 instead of python.

Virtual Environment Issues: If you're having trouble with the virtual environment, make sure it's activated. The terminal should display (venv) at the beginning of the command line. If not, activate it again using:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
